I have been learning web development from Free Code Camp for the past year. During this time I have learn't HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. I have completed the Front-end certification and is now working on the Data Visualization Certificate where I am now learning ReactJs. I am yet to complete the 4 Reactjs projects. Learning Web Development without any help from individuals around me have taught me self reliance. I am now an intrinsically motivated individual who can learn on my own.</p>

<p>I have given myself 4 years to become a Full-Stack Developer from Free Code Camp's JavaScript Stack. I am yet to learn NodeJS and Expressjs. I have a basic understanding of both but I am Yet to create a few projects using Nodejs and Expressjs. I plan to learn other language after completing Free Code Camp. Languages such as Python for ML, Swift for IOS applications and Java/C# in the far future.</p>

<p>My ultimate goal at this point in my life is to become a Full-Stack Developer by year 2020.</p>

Very passionate about technology, the way it is evolving and what it has to offer. I'm a fan of <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Scala</strong>, <strong>Objective-C</strong>, and <strong>Hypermedia APIs</strong>. I mainly work with opensource tools, because of their flexibility, the power they have to offer and most importantly the community of developers that helps to build and enhance them. Also, I occasionally dabble in <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Android</strong> to build cool stuff, but my primary area of concentration is creating Web Applications. So, I've started to venture into the deep end of various web frameworks to learn how they work and why they work the way they do and also to get a better understanding of how to create better <em>APIs</em>, because my aim is to contribute to a better web experience in the future.</p>
